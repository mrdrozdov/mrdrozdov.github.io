I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at UMass Amherst and member of both [UMass NLP](https://nlp.cs.umass.edu/) and [IESL](http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/). I work with Professors [Andrew McCallum](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/) and [Mohit Iyyer](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/) on developing neural methods for text processing. My research interests are in automatic structure discovery, instance-based learning, and text generation.

Previously, I've completed my Master's in Computer Science at NYU where I worked with Professors [Samuel Bowman](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/) and [Kyunghyun Cho](https://kyunghyuncho.me/), and was a member of [ML2](https://wp.nyu.edu/ml2/) and [CILVR](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/). While at NYU I worked with reinforcement learning and deep syntactic models for natural language understanding.

I've also interned at [Google AI](https://ai.google/research/) and [IBM](https://research.ibm.com/), and worked multiple years as a Software Engineer before starting graduate school.

In my junior year of college I wrote and presented a tutorial on quantum algorithms aimed for undergraduate students in computer science, available [here](/assets/pdf/quantum_tutorial.pdf), along with slides: [part 1](/assets/pdf/quantum_presentation_1.pdf) and [part 2](/assets/pdf/quantum_presentation_2.pdf).
